## Recommendations for Oily, Sweat-Prone Skin

1. **Maybelline SuperStay Full Coverage Foundation** - Oil-free, silicone-dominant formula with good sweat resistance. Full coverage, matte finish, sets in 10 minutes. Lasts 8-12 hours realistically. Budget-friendly. Note: Oxidizes significantly (darkens cooler), so size down 1-2 shades.

2. **Bobbi Brown Weightless Skin Foundation** - Smart Skin-Balancing Technology controls oil without stripping. Waterproof, sweat-resistant, 24-hour wear. Minimizes pores. Better oxidation control than Maybelline. Prestige price point.

3. **Smashbox Always On Skin-Balancing Foundation** - Adaptogens (licorice root, sea asparagus) balance oil and hydration. Water, sweat, humidity, and transfer-resistant. Excellent color stability (minimal oxidation). Mid-range pricing.

All three are monsoon-proof and rated for hot, humid climates.
