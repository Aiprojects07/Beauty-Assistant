## Shade Description

MAC Ruby Woo is an iconic vivid blue-red—a cool-toned, crisp cherry red with zero orange warmth. The blue undertone makes teeth appear whiter and creates that classic Hollywood red lip effect. It's universally flattering because the blue sits opposite warm tones in skin, creating beautiful complementary contrast.

**Fair Indian skin (NC15-NC25):** Reads bold and high-contrast. Pair with groomed brows and blush to balance on bare face.

**Medium Indian skin (NC25-NC35):** Looks rich, luxe, and camera-ready. The blue-red balances golden/olive undertones without turning brick. Works with minimal makeup.

**Deeper Indian skin (NC45+):** Very bright and attention-grabbing. If too stark, outline with deep red or brown liner first to ground the color.

Available in Retro Matte (ultra-flat, longest-wearing), MACximal Silky Matte (more comfortable), and liquid/gloss versions.
